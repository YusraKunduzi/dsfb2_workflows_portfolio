# Looking ahead

**Where do I want to be in ~2 years time?**

In two years time i expect myself to be recently graduated from Hogeschool Utrecht (Life Science). I will work at a company focused on research within the life sciences, specifically in a department that specializes in microbiological research, where I am also able to apply my data science skills. I expect to be more confident in my data science and researching skills.
Looking even further ahead, I plan on leading research projects in my field and publish my findings to contribute to the scientific community. .

**How am I doing now with respect to this goal?**

I’m well on my way to achieving my goals. Sometimes, I don’t fully realize how much I’ve learned over the past few years, but I often surprise myself when I excel at my work. I’m currently focusing on enhancing my data science skills and I will begin my research internship in February, which is the final phase of my studies before graduation.

**What would be the next skill to learn?**

One skill I’m excited to develop is working in larger teams after I graduate. Although I've had experience working in smaller groups, which has gone well, I look forward to collaborating with a larger team and learning how to navigate that dynamic effectively.
