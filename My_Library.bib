	abstract = {Tripterygium glycosides (TG) have been reported to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the mechanism involved remains to be determined. In the present study, the lncRNA and circRNA expression profiles of an AD mouse model treated with TG were assessed using microarrays. lncRNAs, mRNAs, and circRNAs in the hippocampi of 3 AD+normal saline (NS) mice and 3 AD+TG mice were detected using microarrays. The most differentially expressed lncRNAs, mRNAs, and circRNAs were screened between the AD+NS and AD+TG groups. The differentially expressed lncRNAs and circRNAs were analyzed using GO enrichment and KEGG analyses. Co-expression analysis of lncRNAs, circRNAs, and mRNAs was performed by calculating the correlation coefficients. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was performed on mRNAs using STRING. The lncRNA-target-transcription factor (TF) network was analyzed using the Network software. In total, 661 lncRNAs, 64 circRNAs, and 503 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in AD mice treated with TG. Pou4f1, Egr2, Mag, and Nr4a1 were the hub genes in the PPI network. The KEGG results showed that the mRNAs that were co-expressed with lncRNAs were enriched in the TNF, PI3K-Akt, and Wnt signaling pathways. LncRNA-target-TF network analysis indicated that TFs, including Cebpa, Zic2, and Rxra, were the most likely to regulate the detected lncRNAs. The circRNA-miRNA interaction network indicated that 275 miRNAs may bind to the 64 circRNAs. In conclusion, these findings provide a novel perspective on AD pathogenesis, and the detected lncRNAs, mRNAs, and circRNAs may serve as novel therapeutic targets for the management of AD.},

              The objective of this research was to extend the Vitek MS fungal knowledge base version 2.0.0 to allow the robust identification of clinically relevant dermatophytes, using a variety of strains, incubation times, and growth conditions. First, we established a quick and reliable method for sample preparation to obtain a reliable and reproducible identification independently of the growth conditions. The Vitek MS V2.0.0 fungal knowledge base was then expanded using 134 well-characterized strains belonging to 17 species in the genera
              Epidermophyton
              ,
              Microsporum
              , and
              Trichophyton
              . Cluster analysis based on mass spectrum similarity indicated good species discrimination independently of the culture conditions. We achieved a good separation of the subpopulations of the
              Trichophyton
              anamorph of
              Arthroderma benhamiae
              and of anthropophilic and zoophilic strains of
              Trichophyton interdigitale
              . Overall, the 1,130 mass spectra obtained for dermatophytes gave an estimated identification performance of 98.4\%. The expanded fungal knowledge base was then validated using 131 clinical isolates of dermatophytes belonging to 13 taxa. For 8 taxa all strains were correctly identified, and for 3 the rate of successful identification was {\textgreater}90\%; 75\% (6/8) of the
              M. gypseum
              strains were correctly identified, whereas only 47\% (18/38) of the African
              T. rubrum
              population (also called
              T. soudanense
              ) were recognized accurately, with a large quantity of strains misidentified as
              T. violaceum
              , demonstrating the close relationship of these two taxa. The method of sample preparation was fast and efficient and the expanded Vitek MS fungal knowledge base reliable and robust, allowing reproducible dermatophyte identifications in the routine laboratory.},

Therefore, it has been widely used in varied applications such as clinical, food, military, and ecological research. However, the MALDI TOF MS method is laced with many challenges including its limitation of the reference spectrum. This review briefly introduces the background of MALDI TOF MS technology, including sample preparation and workflow. We have primarily discussed the application of MALDI TOF MS in the identification of microorganisms. Furthermore, we have discussed the current trends for bioaerosol detection using MALDI TOF MS and the limitations and challenges involved, and finally the approaches to overcome these challenges.},

A total of 580 clinical isolates and stock collection strains belonging to 116 taxa were included in the study. Of the 249 gram-positive strains tested with both the ID-GPC and GP cards, 218 (87.5\%) and 235 (94.4\%) strains were correctly identified (to the genus and species level), respectively. Of the 331 gram-negative strains tested with the ID-GNB and GN cards, 295 (89.1\%) and 321 (97\%) strains were correctly identified, respectively. Another focus of the study was to apply the percentages of correct identifications obtained in this study to the list of bacteria isolated in our laboratory (32,739 isolates) in the year 2004. We obtained 97.9\% correct identifications with the colorimetric cards and 93.9\% with fluorescent cards.},

Although both the broth dilution and agar screen methods disclosed no discordance, Vitek GPS-418 cards yielded a very major error compared with the results obtained by the reference broth dilution method of the NCCLS.
