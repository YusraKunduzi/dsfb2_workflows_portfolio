Aangezien mijn afstudeerrichting microbiologie is, sluit dit onderwerp er goed bij aan. De ruwe data die ik zal gebruiken komt van GEO, onder de accession GSE197084. In dit onderzoek werd het effect van transposons op de virulentie van Escherichia coli bestudeerd. Het genoom van E. coli werd eerst gesequenced, waarna transposons werden geïntroduceerd. De gemuteerde bacteriën werden vervolgens geïmplanteerd in de hersenen, milt en longen van muizen om de effecten van de gemuteerde bacteriën in verschillende omgevingen te bestuderen. Na de infectie werden de bacteriën opnieuw gesequenced. Mijn doel is om de data van de E. coli voor en na transposon-insertie te vergelijken en een bredere analyse te maken van de genen en biologische processen die mogelijk zijn beïnvloed door de transposons. Ik ben niet alleen geïnteresseerd in virulentie-gerelateerde genen, maar wil ook onderzoeken hoe andere genetische processen mogelijk zijn aangepast door de transposons. Voor de analyse zal ik ongeveer dezelfde workflow gebruiken als in DAUR2. Ik zal de analyse volledig uitvoeren in Python en daarbij ook andere technieken gebruiken, zoals BWA i.p.v. Bowtie2 of Rsubread, en Sambamba i.p.v. Rsamtools. Door deze tools te gebruiken, kan ik de analyse in een andere programmeertaal uitvoeren en tegelijkertijd de methoden en concepten die ik tijdens de cursus heb geleerd toepassen. "],["looking-ahead.html", "4 Looking ahead", " 4 Looking ahead Where do I want to be in ~2 years time? In two years time i expect myself to be recently graduated from Hogeschool Utrecht (Life Science). I will work at a company focused on research within the life sciences, specifically in a department that specializes in microbiological research, where I am also able to apply my data science skills. I expect to be more confident in my data science and researching skills. Looking even further ahead, I plan on leading research projects in my field and publish my findings to contribute to the scientific community. . How am I doing now with respect to this goal? I’m well on my way to achieving my goals. Sometimes, I don’t fully realize how much I’ve learned over the past few years, but I often surprise myself when I excel at my work. I’m currently focusing on enhancing my data science skills and I will begin my research internship in February, which is the final phase of my studies before graduation. What would be the next skill to learn? One skill I’m excited to develop is working in larger teams after I graduate. Although I’ve had experience working in smaller groups, which has gone well, I look forward to collaborating with a larger team and learning how to navigate that dynamic effectively.

To solve this, the log10 value of compConcentration is used, reducing the distance between data points. Another issue is that compConcentration being of the class ‘character’ disrupts the order in which the data is displayed. RawData is of class ‘numeric’, which is correct. compName and expType were both initially of class ‘character’ and have been changed to ‘factor’. compConcentration was of class ‘character’, but changed to ‘numeric’. The positive control for this experiment is Ethanol. The negative control for this experiment is S-medium. Normalizing the data gives a baseline for comparison, reducing variability. This makes it easier to spot meaningful differences by ensuring that any changes are due to the experimental conditions, not just natural differences in the data. 6.1 Analyzing the data If this experiment is analyzed to determine if there is an effect of different concentrations on offspring count and whether the compounds have varying effects, the following steps should be followed: Preparation of the Data: First, the data should be imported from the Excel file into RStudio to prepare it for analysis. During this process, columns should be assigned the correct data types, NA values should be removed, and the data should be normalized. Specifically, normalization should ensure that the mean value of the negative control is equal to 1, with all other values expressed as fractions of the negative control. This step is essential for comparing the effects of different compounds consistently. Visualization of the Data with a Scatterplot: This step is important for identifying potential issues with the data and making any necessary adjustments. It allows you to visualize the relationship between compound concentrations and offspring count. Use the compound concentration on the X-axis and the offspring count (RawData) on the Y-axis, with different colors representing each compound and different shapes representing the experimental types. Jitter can be applied to prevent overlapping data points. Dose-Response Curve (DRC): To better analyze the effects of the compounds on C. elegans and assess the relationship between dose and response, a DRC is necessary. This involves fitting a dose-response model using the {drc} package in R. Use the log-transformed compound concentration on the X-axis and the offspring count (RawData) on the Y-axis. The DRC will help quantify key parameters such as the IC50 value, as well as the minimal and maximal response levels. Analysis/Conclusion of the DRC: The analysis should focus on determining the IC50 value for each compound, identifying the minimal and maximal concentrations affecting C. elegans, and comparing the dose-response curves to evaluate differences in compound effects. Controls should be used to validate the experimental results.

This mass spectrometry system utilizes biochemical tests to distinguish between bacterial species based on their distinct responses to a series of chemical reactions.(De Respinis et al. 2014) The process begins by inserting a bacterial solution along with an identification or antibiotics card into the VITEK MS system. Each card contains a set of biochemical tests specific to the bacteria being analyzed. As the bacterial solution is drawn through the card, the system measures the extinction values corresponding to each test, indicating the bacteria’s reaction to the biochemical compounds. Each species has a unique pattern of extinction values, allowing the VITEK MS to accurately identify them based on their specific response patterns. While the VITEK MS is efficient and has a large database for identifying a wide range of organisms, it does have limitations. One of the main challenges is distinguishing closely related bacterial species that exhibit similar biochemical response patterns. For example, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis, both Gram-positive bacteria, are often difficult to differentiate using the VITEK system alone. Their biochemical reaction patterns are so similar that the system frequently produces a combined result, indicating both species are present, rather than providing a definitive identification. This issue also occurs with the MALDI-TOF MS system, which, despite its large database, struggles to differentiate between these closely related species due to their highly similar protein profiles. (Han, Jeong, and Choi 2021) Our project aims to address this limitation by investigating the differences in extinction patterns between S. mitis and S. oralis using the VITEK MS data. Through detailed analysis of the extinction outcomes from the biochemical tests on the Gram-positive cards, we aim to identify even the slightest differences between these two species. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, we will develop an application or website where users can input their VITEK extinction data files. These files will then be processed through custom scripts that allow users to visualize and interpret the data more effectively. The core functionality of the Rshiny app will include the ability to generate visualizations such as scatterplots, boxplots, heatmaps, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots (Yan et al. 2020). These tools will help users better understand how their samples compare across different tests. The primary goal is to provide a more accurate and detailed view of the subtle differences between closely related bacteria like S. mitis and S. oralis. For instance, scatterplots will allow users to see how individual tests correlate, while heatmaps will highlight patterns of bacterial response across all tests. PCA plots will help users observe the overall distribution of their samples, making it easier to spot any clustering or outliers that may indicate different bacterial species. Already, some differences have been observed in the extinction patterns of certain tests between S. mitis and S. oralis. These findings have led to the development of a new feature for the Rshiny app: a Mitis/Oralis Checker. This tool will allow users to input their VITEK data and receive a more straightforward answer regarding whether they are dealing with S. mitis or S. oralis. The checker will be based on the identified patterns from the biochemical tests and will use the data from the visualizations as a reference. While the checker provides a quick and user-friendly solution, users will still have the option to view the detailed plots and analyses to understand the basis of the checker’s conclusions. For now, the app will support any bacteria tested with the Gram-positive card, ensuring that a wide range of samples can be analyzed. This tool has the potential to improve bacterial identification accuracy in clinical microbiology by providing more precise results, especially in cases where traditional systems like the VITEK MS may fall short. Ultimately, our project aims to enhance the ability to distinguish between similar bacterial species. Because the Rshiny app is already set up for Gram-positive identification cards, adding the information and tests for a Gram-negative card would not be difficult (Tanaka and Weisblum 1975). Researching and obtaining data from other bacteria that are difficult to distinguish would be helpful in developing additional checkers, like the Mitis/Oralis checker. Although these additions would be valuable, they are outside the scope of the current project and could be explored in future projects. bibliography: My_Library.bib "],["references.html", "9 References", " 9 References De Respinis, Sophie, Valérie Monnin, Victoria Girard, Martin Welker, Maud Arsac, Béatrice Cellière, Géraldine Durand, et al. 2014. “Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization–Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry Using the Vitek MS System for Rapid and Accurate Identification of Dermatophytes on Solid Cultures.” Edited by Y.-W.
