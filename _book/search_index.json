Part of this research focuses on genome sequencing to identify various variants, but there has been limited research on how these mutations affect processes like virus replication or transmission. This article presents research on 14 different SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerged during the early stages of the pandemic in Europe. The goal of this research was to gain a better understanding of these variants. To achieve this, the variants were isolated from anonymized patient samples collected in Switzerland between March and May 2020. These samples were cultured in Vero-CCL81 cells, and primary bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs) from three different human donors were also used to grow the variants. The virus was cultured through multiple passages in Vero-CCL81 cells to generate viral stocks. The viral growth, genetic variants, and specific mutations, such as those in the Spike protein and other genes, were analyzed using sequencing and phenotypic assays. The full genome sequencing was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. The results showed that certain mutations, such as the D614G substitution in the Spike protein, were associated with enhanced replication in human cells. Additionally, mutations that occurred during passage in Vero cells, such as deletions in the furin cleavage site, strongly affected replication in BEpCs. This highlights the importance of carefully checking viral stocks when studying new variants. Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA and unpaired t-tests on log2-transformed data. The research was conducted in a BSL3 facility, with all procedures, including risk assessments and protective measures, approved by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. All relevant data are available through GISAID (accession IDs EPI_ISL_590823 to EPI_ISL_590836). Although the article does not provide specific information on the availability of the code used, it offers extensive methodological details and transparency in the results.

Also called the study objective. Yes Data Availability Statement A statement, in an individual section offset from the main body of text, that explains how or if one can access a study’s data. The title of the section may vary, but it must explicitly mention data; it is therefore distinct from a supplementary materials section.

Yes Code Availability Authors have shared access to the most updated code that they used in their study, including code used for analysis. No 7.2 Reprocudibility assessment Reproducibility in research is necessary as it allows other researchers to use the data and code for their own work. Unfortunately, the data or code isn’t always accessible, sometimes hindering progress. Even when both are available, it’s important to assess whether the code is truly reproducible. This is why I reviewed a paper titled “Effect of Targeted Behavioral Science Messages on COVID-19 Vaccination Registration Among Employees of a Large Health System” on PubMed. The code and data for this study were available on OSF, with one file for the scripts and three files for the data. After reviewing the code, I would rate its readability a 3/5. While the code is not bad, it could be clearer. Some variable names were understandable, but as the number of variables increased, they became less clear. The code could also benefit from more consistent comments. The reproducibility of the code is a 5/5. The three lines for importing the data, with placeholders for file paths like “INSERT PATH HERE” were clear. After inserting my own file paths, the code ran without issues, generating a bar chart identical to the one in the paper. The code first loads the datasets, then summarizes key variables like registration numbers, email opens, clicks, and deliveries. After preparing and cleaning the data, it generates three bar charts for visualisation. library(dplyr) library(psych) library(gmodels) library(zoo) ## for working with dates library(chron) ##for working with dates library(ggplot2) library(effects) ## for CI library(DT) ## for tables library(RColorBrewer) ## for survey plot VAC.SURVEY.PATH &lt;- &quot;C:/Users/yusra/OneDrive/Documenten/dsfb2_workflows_portfolio/ruwe_data/COVID_Vaccine_Employee_Survey_20210202_OSF.csv&quot; VAC.SURVEY &lt;- read.csv(gsub(&quot;[\\r\\n]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, VAC.SURVEY.PATH), header = TRUE, na.strings = c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;N/A&quot;, &quot;NA&quot;)) total &lt;- nrow(VAC.SURVEY) freq_table &lt;- data.frame(table(VAC.SURVEY$main)) names(freq_table) &lt;- c(&quot;Codes&quot;, &quot;Freq&quot;) tmp &lt;- freq_table %&gt;% arrange(Freq) freq_table$Codes &lt;- factor(freq_table$Codes, levels = tmp$Codes) freq_table$Perc &lt;- paste(round((freq_table$Freq/total)*100,1), &quot;%&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) ggplot(freq_table, aes(x = Codes, y = Freq, fill = Codes)) + geom_bar(stat = &#39;identity&#39;, position = position_dodge(), color = &#39;black&#39;) + theme_classic() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 1, hjust = 1), axis.text = element_text(size = 7, color = &#39;black&#39;), strip.text = element_text(size = 7), axis.title = element_text(size = 7), axis.title.y = element_text(margin = unit(c(5, 0, 0, 0, 0), &quot;mm&quot;)), legend.position = &#39;none&#39;) + xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ylab(&quot;\\nNumber of respondents&quot;) + geom_text(aes(label=Perc), size=3, position=position_dodge(width=0.9), hjust=-0.2, color=&#39;black&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &quot;#1B7837&quot;, &quot;#5AAE61&quot;, &quot;#A6DBA0&quot;, &quot;#D9F0D3&quot;, &quot;#F7F7F7&quot;, &quot;#E7D4E8&quot;, &quot;#C2A5CF&quot;, &quot;#9970AB&quot;, &quot;#762A83&quot;)) + coord_flip() + ylim(c(0, max(freq_table$Freq)*1.3)) Figure X: titel en bijschrift "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
